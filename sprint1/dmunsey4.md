## What I didn't do
Everything that was assigned this sprint for our group was complete

## What problems did I encounter
- There was one issue with generating rook/bishop/queen moves that was relating to a function made to return the most significant bit. Debugging this function took some time
- Creating the Makefile was a learning experience
