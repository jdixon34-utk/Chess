### What I accomplished
I was able to successfully setup the SvelteKit and link in TailwindCSS properly. From here, I went ahead and structured the pages we plan to have for the website by creating the routes to these pages in the routes/ directory. Finally, I decided to create the Navbar component of our webpage and to coded it for mobile as well.
