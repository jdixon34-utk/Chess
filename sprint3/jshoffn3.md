Group: ChessWebsite

### What I planned to do
- Front-end Rook Move Check
    * #65 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/65)
- Complete "How To Play" page

- Front-end Style Update
    * #68 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/68)

### What I did not do
- I still need to make the new chess pieces a bit bigger relative the the square sizes. I also need to either fix mobile or just get rid of it completely for the final product.

### What problems I encountered
- I could not get the pathing to work for the new chess pieces at first, but with some help from a friend got it to finally work.
- Being able to cover all relevant information in the "How To Play" page. I ended up doing the basics and adding relevant links for more help.

### What I accomplished
While I did not complete a lot of new code, I made sure the quality of the code was better this sprint. Instead of "lorem ipsum" I was able to do some research and put actual relevant information on the "How To Play" page. I was able to finally pick a color scheme for the website, as well as get new pieces. Not only this, but I also helped out with a little function on checking valid moves for a Rook and Bishop (bishop get redone by Brandon, but Rook was kept).
