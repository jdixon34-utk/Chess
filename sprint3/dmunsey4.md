# Sprint 3
Devin Munsey, Dev5ter, ChessWebsite

## What you planned to do
- Update Pieces[color] during EnPassMove() functions
    * #58 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/58)
- Disallow Castling Through Check
    * #59 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/59)
- Can't Castle Out of Check
    * #60 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/60)
- Initializer Function for Board Class
    * #61 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/61)
- Call the Initialize Function
    * #62 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/62)
    
## What I didn't do
* I had no other issues assigned

## What problems did I encounter
* There is a bug in the backend somewhere that makes 4 moves at once. These moves sometimes aren't even legal moves so this is a major issue going into sprint 4.

## Files I worked on
* Makefile
* src/board.cpp
* src/board.h
* src/game.cpp

## What I accomplished
* I successfully made it where you can't castle in/out/through check. I alos had to update some functions that turned out not to work once the Front end used them.
