Jake Shoffner (jshoffn3) 

Group: ChessWebsite

### What I planned to do

    * #49 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/49)
- Flesh out About Project page
    * #50 [issue](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/50)

### What I did not do
- I wasn't able to make the chessboard work for mobile the way I wanted it to. It works, but it looks really bad. I plan to spend some time next sprint polishing this.

### What problems I encountered
- Chessboard on mobile still looks terrible.
- Not knowing the text information we want on the About and How to Play pages.

### What I accomplished
I was able to adapt the existing chessboard, with the help of Adam, into a responsive chessboard that changes with the size of the browser. I also, was able to add some more styling to the navbar and then center the chess pieces within the specific square they are in. I then took it upon myself to style/structure the about and how to play pages of the website. I also made the chessboard flexbox, so it is easier in the future to work with and be responsive. Finally, I created a simple footer with all of our group's github's on it, to give us credit.
