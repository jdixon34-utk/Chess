*squareUnderAttack knight
*squareUnderAttack bishop/queen
*squareUnderAttack pawn
*makePromotionMove
*start on evaluation


### What you did not do

### What problems you encountered
*had to refactor code as inCheck function was changed to squareUnderAttack

### Issues you worked on
[#40](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/40) makePawnPromotion
[#39](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/39) squareUnderAttack Pawn
[#38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/38) squareUnderAttack Bishop/Queen
[#37](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess/issues/37) squareUnderAttack Knight

### Files you worked on
board.cpp
board.h


### What you accomplished
I wrote the function to check if a square was under attack by a knight, queen, bishop, or pawn. This was previously only to check if a king was under attack, but it was expanded. I then wrote the function make a pawn promotion move.
