## About ChessWebsite
Our goal was to create a chess website that enabled the user to learn the basics of chess and improve their game over time by playing against our chess engine. 

## Installation
Before we begin, **download the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** from their website. This is needed to install dependencies and run the application.

First, find a location on your system where you want to install the application. Then, **clone the repository** by running the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/Chess.git
```
Next, traverse through the cloned repository and enter the **ChessWebsite** directory:
```
$ cd Chess/Chesswebsite
```
From here, **install all the dependencies** for this project by running:
```
$ npm install
```
You have installed the application and are all set! 

## How to Run

To play, in the **ChessWebsite** directory, just run this command:
```
$ npm run dev
```
This will **create a local server** and output the address to use in your browser to access the website.
```
> Local:   http://localhost:xxxx/ (Where xxxx is just some port)
```

When done using the application, **kill the server** with:
```
$ <CTRL + C>
```
