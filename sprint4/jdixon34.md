### What you accomplished
This sprint consisted mainly of lots of testing and debugging. I helped debug checkmate/stalemate and a
multitude of other small issues that would pop up. I then wrote code in the search function to implement
alpha-beta pruning. Currently, this allows the engine to look at about 80% less positions and still return 
the same result. I planned on implementing a move sort to make the alpha-beta pruning even more effective. 
I have the idea planned out, but haven't have time to implement it yet.
