## What I Accomplished
Well, without trying to add a bunch of bells and whistles, the backend was mostly done before this sprint arrived except for disallowing castling if a rook moved and then moved back to its starting posistion. This task was not as easy as I thought it would've been to solve, and took up my entire sprint because I had to try about 4 different methods before it ended up working.
