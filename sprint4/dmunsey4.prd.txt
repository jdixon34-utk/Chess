ChessWebsite (ChadChess)

BACKGROUND:

Our product is a website that offers the service of playing chess against an engine.
This product doesn't solve any major earthly problems.
They are other websites that let you do this exact same thing and more.
BUT, this could be used as a product for people trying to host random games on a website.
Our engine does work; it might not be the greatest engine, but it can beat you.
