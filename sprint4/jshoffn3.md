### What you accomplished
I was able to complete a lot this sprint. Even though we were nearly done, I really wanted to make the front-end look as good as possible. I finished the about page of the website. I made a UI to select what color to start as. I made a UI for pawn promotion. I then restyled the entire website and picked a scheme that actually works. That means I restyled the board, text colors, and the UI's that I created.
